# Ecology is the Main Driver of Primate Brain Size Evolution

The given repository contains all code necessary for the analyses of the project 'Ecology is the Main Driver of Primate Brain Size Evolution'.


## R Files

* `00_socio_ecology_functions.R`: all functions which are used in the files `01_socio_ecology_data_prep.R` and `02_socio_ecology_analyses.Rmd`.

* `01_socio_ecology_data_prep.R`: Data preparation. Required in `02_socio_ecology_analyses.Rmd`.

* `02_socio_ecology_analyses.Rmd`: Actual analyses for paper and appendix.

* `Analyses_old/Socio_ecology_primates_Appnedix_short.Rnw`: original analyses of Appendix document. Very very messy! 
The analyses are recoded and restructure in the new file `02_socio_ecology_analyses.Rmd` with corresponding functions saved in `00_socio_ecology_functions.R`.

* `Analyses_old/Socio_ecology_primates_Appnedix_short.Rnw`: all origin analyses. Very very messy! The most important analyses used in paper
are newly saved in `02_socio_ecology_analyses.Rmd`.



## Data files

* `appendix_primate_data_3.txt`: complete data set used for analyses (with family names and HR size --> joined to original file with appendix_primate_data_2.txt).

* `Perelman292res.nex`: phylogenetic tree by perelman. Probably manually adjusted by Karin Isler.
